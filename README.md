### Ideas:

*  A Score Based, Movement, proc-gen game where the screen is devided into two sides, left is controlled by keyboard, right by mouse. To keep moving you have to maintain balance with both mouse and keyboard

* A score based game where you pass a ball between two sides of the screen, each side controlled by mouse and keyboard. The longer you keep going the harder it becomes.

* A game where one makes a chain, linking together parts that appear on screen. The longer the chain, the more points you get.

* A platformer-like game, where to keep going you balance from proc-gen appearing blocks to the next. The farther you go the scarcer the block become.

* TWEWY-like game
